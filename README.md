Display GPS Logger output file w. Open Street Map

GPS Logger is an Android app by Mendhak:
https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mendhak.gpslogger

Use the text file option in GPS Logger.  Upload the resulting text file with getfiles.html

Uses OpenLayers to interface with Open Street Map:
http://openlayers.org/

Substantial portion of encode.php borrowed from Piotr and Oskar:
http://jsfiddle.net/_DR_/Pkcaf/

It works without problems with Firefox.
With Chrome, it displays the itinerary plotted from the log file, but does not display the map layer.
With Opera Mobile and Dolphin (on Android), it won't even upload the file.

Reports on whether it works with your browser are of course welcome.
